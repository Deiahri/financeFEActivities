      <h2>Credit Cards</h2>
      <h3>What even is that?</h3>

        Imagine this: a credit card, your handy little financial tool to help
        you cover monthly expensesâ€”like a personal assistant in your wallet.
        <br />
        But here's the real kicker: it's more than just a way to pay. It's a
        chance to master the art of borrowing! Think of it as a warm-up for
        future goals, like buying a car, owning a home, or even starting a
        business.
        <br />
        Why not start now? With lower risk and manageable payments, you can
        build your credit and sharpen those money skills for the bigger
        financial leaps down the road!
